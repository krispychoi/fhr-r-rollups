#######################################################################


## Is the profile considered targeted by the change to Yahoo?
## This grouping is based on distribution and locale, and optionally 
## on geo and current version.
##
## All of these profiles should have gotten the default change on updating
## to v34+, if they updated, unless their default search engine was set to 
## something other than Google. Profiles not belonging to this group should 
## not have gotten the default change, and are generally not of interest 
## in our analysis.
##
## Targeted profile are on en-US locale, and "mozilla" or "yahoo" distribution
## type (as returned by majorDistribValue). They should also be in the physical
## US (checked if 'geo' is supplied) and have a current version of 34.0 or 
## later (checked if 'version' is supplied).
## Arguments are the locale string, major distribution identifier, two-letter
## geoCountry code, and current browser version.
isTargetedY <- function(locale, distribtype, geo = NULL, version = NULL) {
    targeted <- identical(locale, "en-US") && 
        distribtype %in% c("mozilla", "yahoo")
    if(!is.null(geo)) targeted <- targeted && identical(geo, "US")
    if(!is.null(version)) {
        targeted <- targeted && grepl("^\\d{2,}", version) && version > "34"
    }
    targeted
}

## Collects information around updates to v34+, and change of default to Yahoo, 
## if any. 
## 
## Versions 34+ saw the launch of the new search UI (landed in different 
## versions, depending on locale), and a change of search default to a new 
## partner for some profiles (eg. Yahoo for en-US/geo US).
## 
## This function helps identify profiles that updated to v34+ or were newly
## created on one of those versions, as well as profiles that got a change
## of search default. 
##
## For profiles that are targeted by the change to Yahoo (profile is from 
## the physical US and isTargetedY() is TRUE), the function first looks for 
## UITour measurements. This is considered the most reliable source of 
## information. If it is not present, information is inferred by looking for 
## FHR version updates, and the profile is considered to have gotten the 
## change of search default if the profile has been on the new version and 
## was targeted. 
##
## While this is primarily intended for gathering information about the change
## to Yahoo, it should be useable for determining other changes on v34+, 
## such as profiles that got the new UI, or the change to Yandex in the
## "ru" locale, by specifying which profiles are considered targeted 
## as appropriate.
## 
## Arguments are:
## - the data$days list as 'days' containing at least the days from 2014-12-01 
##   onwards (the launch date of v34)
## - the profile creation date as 'pcd' (expected as yyyy-mm-dd and never NA)
## - whether the profile is considered targeted as 'targeted' (for the Yahoo
##   change in the US, this should be the output of 
##      isTargetedY(locale, distribtype, geo))
## 
## Tuning arguments give control over:
## - the minimum version to look for ('.minver', default is "34")
## - the release date of the minimum version ('.minverdate', 
##   default is "2014-12-01"); this is used to determine profiles newly created
##   on the version of interest
## - whether or not to look for UITour information ('.useuit', default is TRUE);
##   should only be used for the change to Yahoo in the US
## - the search engines that will get changed if they are the previous default
##   ('.prevdef', default is "google", NULL means not to check defaults).
## 
## Returns a list containing the following information:
## - has.ver: whether or not the profile has been on a version of interest
##           (>= .minver) at some point (boolean)
## - ver.status: whether the profile updated to the version of interest from an 
##              older version ("updated"), was newly created on the version 
##              ("new"), or has never been on a version of interest ("older").
## - ver.date: the first date on a version of interest (date of update, or 
##            profile creation date for new profiles), or else NA if has.ver
##            is FALSE.
## - new.sdef: whether a new search default was set on ver.date because of the 
##             use of the version of interest, either on updating or on first 
##             use of a new profile 
## - reason: a description of the way these fields were ascertained: 
##     > "uitour" if they were read from a valid UITour measurement
##     > "pcd" if the profile was determined to be newly created based on 
##        profile creation date 
##     > "updates" if it is based on a version update to a version of interest, 
##        possibly with "prevdef" appended if the previous search default was
##        checked
##     > "nodays" if there were no active days during the period of interest
##     > "noupdates" if the profile was not newly created and there was no
##       evidence of having been on a version of interest
##
## If UITour information is present, 'new.sdef' is read from there. Otherwise, 
## it is TRUE iff has.ver is TRUE and the profile was considered targeted, and
## if the profile updated from an older version, the previous search default 
## (as well as can be inferred) is in .prevdef.
## 
## Returns NULL if there are no days.
